It started with the idea of making a cowboy face off type game, but it changed into this dance simon says game with Phineas and Ferb characters because I also thought it be funny. I 3D modeled perry the platypus, and dr doof, looked up image references, and did some animations in Blender. I was not able to fix the animation positions but kept it the way it was it looked fun."

I picked duck hunt as a inspiration because I had never done a 2D game in Unity before so I went with it and recreated the aspects that I could understand. I made the background and other sprites myself using Aesprite, and modeled a gun in Blender then rendered it out."
