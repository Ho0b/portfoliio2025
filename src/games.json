It started with the idea of making a cowboy face off type game, but it changed into this dance simon says game with Phineas and Ferb characters because I also thought it be funny. I 3D modeled perry the platypus, and dr doof, looked up image references, and did some animations in Blender. I was not able to fix the animation positions but kept it the way it was it looked fun.",

I picked duck hunt as a inspiration because I had never done a 2D game in Unity before so I went with it and recreated the aspects that I could understand. I made the background and other sprites myself using Aesprite, and modeled a gun in Blender then rendered it out.",

I started by designing the movement mechanics, models, and graphics, then I programmed the movement, animations and GUI. The hardest part was tweaking the values so that the movement was correct, and or played right.",

The assignment was to figure out how to use Unity's global physics materials, so I made a physics material with a high level of bounce, and then applied it to the ball. I added a vector force when the player hits the ball, and then added a bot that hits it back with a random direction so there was a challenge.",

I made the models and placed it into the scene, and animated the character in Blender and applied it based on the movement. It was difficult because I was not that confident with Unity at the time, but I was slowly learning it more and more as I continued to make more projects.",
